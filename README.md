Furthermore, on every Adventsonntag, a candle will light up.

### Lessons Learned: 

Scriptable Object (SC)

It is basically a class one can derive from if one wants to create objects which do not need to be attached to certain game objects.
For assets which are only meant to store data, it is most useful.

It has properties like "name" and "hideFlags" and public methods like "ToString".

One can easily create them with "CreateAssetMenuAttribute".
